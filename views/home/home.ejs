        <p>I'm Chris Khalife and I upload bass videos to YouTube under the name "My Bassist Chris". I have been uploading videos for nine years and have been playing bass for fourteen years. My first instrument I learned at the age of nine was piano, but transitioned to guitar at age twelve and bass shortly after. I chose the name My Bassist Chris for two reasons: To pay homage to my favorite band My Chemical Romance and because being a bassist in many bands people would refer to me as my bassist Chris. 
        </p>
    
        <p>I strive to make my bass covers as accurate as possible. I strongly believe it extremely challenging to play a studio bass line note for note as opposed to a cover that is 90% accurate. While my channel first started as purely bass covers, I eventually started making videos on bass gear. I have a huge addiction to buying pedals for bass and love to demonstrate all of pedals I have collected over the years.
       </p>
    
        <p>Feel free to look around the website for my bass tabs, gear collection, and social media links. Also feel free to reach out to me anytime on my social media platforms!</p>
